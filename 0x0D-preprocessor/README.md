# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
 This repository contains solutions to the ALX Software Engineering program's "0x0D. C - Preprocessor" task. The tasks primarily focus on understanding and implementing preprocessor directives, macros, and include guards in C programming.

 ## Files

 0-object_like_macro.h: Header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

1-pi.h: Header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

2-main.c: Program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

3-function_like_macro.h: Header file that contains a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

4-sum.h: Header file that defines a macro named SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.

101-preprocessor_abuse.c: Program that prints "Hello, Holberton" followed by a new line, using a single line of macro code.
